# metastasis

Metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer deaths, and it is still the least understood part of cancer biology. The goal of The Metastasis Project is to survey the existing knowledge on metastasis, and research promising methods to defeating metastatic cancer. Immunotherapy is in focus because the number of cells involved in the systemic spread of cancer cells likely needs to be overcome with a corresponding number of cells from the immune system.
