T-cell-mediated immunity {.unnumbered}\n\n## Development and function of secondary lymphoid organs &ndash; sites for the initiation of adaptive immune responses\n\n### 9-1. T and B lymphocytes are found in distinct locations in secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs)\n\n1. Spleen\n    - **only connected to blood, not to the lymphatics!**\n    - The marginal sinus separates the **white pulp** from the **red pulp**\n        - The marginal sinus is made of blood vessels that branch from the **central arteriole**\n    - White pulp\n        - B-cell follicles\n            - B-cell follicles contain networks **follicular DCs (FDCs)** in the area of the follicle most distance from the central arteriole\n        - PALS\n            - PALS contain bone marrow-derived (i.e. typical DC lineage) **interdigitating DCs**, of which there are two main subtypes\n                - CD8+\n                - CD8-; (CD11b:CD18)+\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./ch9/spleen.png\" />\n\n_Janeway's Immunobiology (Figure 9-1)_\n:::\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./ch9/FDC-germinal-center.png\" />\n\nSchematic of a B-cell follicle in the spleen. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) have long processes that can capture antigen in **immune complexes** (complexes of antigen, antibody, and complement).\n\n(source: _Heesters, B., Myers, R. & Carroll, M.

Lymph nodes\n    - connects to **both lymphatics and blood**\n    - B-cell follicles are located just under the **outer capsule** of the lymph node\n    - T-cell zones surround the follicles in **paracortical areas**\n    - lymph entering lymph nodes enter the **subcapsular space (=marginal sinus)**\n        - the lymph contains antigen and antigen-bearing DCs from the tissues\n    - T and B cells enter the lymph node via special blood vessels called **high endothelial venules (HEVs)**, found in the T-cell zones\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./ch9/lymph-node.png\" />\n<br />\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./ch9/lymph-node2.png\" />\n\n(source: Figure 9-1 from _Janeway's Immunobiology, 9th ed._; Michiel van den Brand, _Hematopathology_)\n:::\n\n3. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs)\n    - **Peyer's patches** are lymph node-like structures (contain both a T-cell zone and B-cell follicles)\n        - Peyer's patches are interspersed beneath the gut epithelium\n        - **M cells** channel antigens and pathogens to the Peyer's patches\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./ch9/peyers-patch.png\" />\n\n(source: Figure 9-1 from _Janeway's Immunobiology, 9th ed._)\n:::\n\n### 9-2. The development of SLTs is controlled by lymphoid tissue inducer cells and proteins of the tumor necrosis factor family\n- lymphatics develop from endothelial cells that originate in blood vessels\n    - said endothelial cells express Prox1 (homeobox transcription factor) $\\to$ endothelial cells bud from vein, migrate away, and reassociate to form a parallel network of lymphatic vessels\n- as lymphatics form, _hematopoietic cells_ called **lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells** are formed in the fetal **liver** and travel via the bloodstream to propspective lymph nodes and Peyer's patches\n    - LTi cells produce TNF cytokines (and others) which recruit lymphoid cells to form the lymph nodes\n    - **lymphotoxins (LTs)** $\\in$ TNF-family cytokines; different lymph nodes depend on signals from different LTs\n        - **LT-$\\alpha_3$**. cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes\n        - **LT-$\\alpha_2$:$\\beta$ (often referred to as just LT-$\\beta$)**. all other lymph nodes; also involved in developing the Peyer's patches\n    - LTi cells express LT-$\\beta$ $\\to$ LT-$\\beta$ activates non-canonical NFkB pathway in stromal cells\n        - $\\to$ stromal cells express adhesion molecules\n        - $\\to$ stromal cells express chemokines such as **CXCL13 (=B-lymphocyte cytokine, BLC)**\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./ch9/mesenteric-lymph-nodes.png\" />\n\nThe mesentery is a fold of membrane that _attaches_ the _intestine_ to the _abdominal wall_ and holds it in place.\n(Source: _Healthline_)\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-lymphotoxins}\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"./ch9/figure9-2.png\" />\n\nThe role of TNF family members in the development of peripheral (secondary) lymphoid organs.\n(source: Figure 9-2 from _Janeway's Immunobiology, 9th ed._)\n:::\n\n## Priming of naive T cells by pathogen-activated DCs\n\n## General properties of effector T cells and their cytokines\n\n## T-cell mediated cytotoxicity\n\n",
