# Chapter 9. T-cell-mediated immunity {.unnumbered}

## Development and function of secondary lymphoid organs &ndash; sites for the initiation of adaptive immune responses

### 9-1. T and B lymphocytes are found in distinct locations in secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs)

1. Spleen
    - **only connected to blood, not to the lymphatics!**
    - The marginal sinus separates the **white pulp** from the **red pulp**
        - The marginal sinus is made of blood vessels that branch from the **central arteriole**
    - White pulp
        - B-cell follicles
            - B-cell follicles contain networks **follicular DCs (FDCs)** in the area of the follicle most distance from the central arteriole
        - PALS
            - PALS contain bone marrow-derived (i.e. typical DC lineage) **interdigitating DCs**, of which there are two main subtypes
                - CD8+
                - CD8-; (CD11b:CD18)+

Schematic of a B-cell follicle in the spleen. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) have long processes that can capture antigen in **immune complexes** (complexes of antigen, antibody, and complement).

2. Lymph nodes
    - connects to **both lymphatics and blood**
    - B-cell follicles are located just under the **outer capsule** of the lymph node
    - T-cell zones surround the follicles in **paracortical areas**
    - lymph entering lymph nodes enter the **subcapsular space (=marginal sinus)**
        - the lymph contains antigen and antigen-bearing DCs from the tissues
    - T and B cells enter the lymph node via special blood vessels called **high endothelial venules (HEVs)**, found in the T-cell zones

3. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs)
    - **Peyer's patches** are lymph node-like structures (contain both a T-cell zone and B-cell follicles)
        - Peyer's patches are interspersed beneath the gut epithelium
        - **M cells** channel antigens and pathogens to the Peyer's patches

### 9-2. The development of SLTs is controlled by lymphoid tissue inducer cells and proteins of the tumor necrosis factor family
- lymphatics develop from endothelial cells that originate in blood vessels
    - said endothelial cells express Prox1 (homeobox transcription factor) $\to$ endothelial cells bud from vein, migrate away, and reassociate to form a parallel network of lymphatic vessels
- as lymphatics form, _hematopoietic cells_ called **lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells** are formed in the fetal **liver** and travel via the bloodstream to propspective lymph nodes and Peyer's patches
    - LTi cells produce TNF cytokines (and others) which recruit lymphoid cells to form the lymph nodes
    - **lymphotoxins (LTs)** $\in$ TNF-family cytokines; different lymph nodes depend on signals from different LTs
        - **LT-$\alpha_3$**. cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes
        - **LT-$\alpha_2$:$\beta$ (often referred to as just LT-$\beta$)**. all other lymph nodes; also involved in developing the Peyer's patches
    - LTi cells express LT-$\beta$ $\to$ LT-$\beta$ activates non-canonical NFkB pathway in stromal cells
        - $\to$ stromal cells express adhesion molecules
        - $\to$ stromal cells express chemokines such as **CXCL13 (=B-lymphocyte cytokine, BLC)**
