T and B lymphocytes are found in distinct locations in secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs)\n\nSpleen\n\nonly connected to blood, not to the lymphatics!\nThe marginal sinus separates the white pulp from the red pulp\n\nThe marginal sinus is made of blood vessels that branch from the central arteriole\n\nWhite pulp\n\nB-cell follicles\n\nB-cell follicles contain networks follicular DCs (FDCs) in the area of the follicle most distance from the central arteriole\n\nPALS\n\nPALS contain bone marrow-derived (i.e. typical DC lineage) interdigitating DCs, of which there are two main subtypes\n\nCD8+\nCD8-; (CD11b:CD18)+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaneway’s Immunobiology (Figure 9-1)\n\n\nSchematic of a B-cell follicle in the spleen. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) have long processes that can capture antigen in immune complexes (complexes of antigen, antibody, and complement).\n(source: Heesters, B., Myers, R. & Carroll, M. Follicular dendritic cells: dynamic antigen libraries. Nat Rev Immunol 14, 495–504 (2014).)\n\n\nLymph nodes\n\nconnects to both lymphatics and blood\nB-cell follicles are located just under the outer capsule of the lymph node\nT-cell zones surround the follicles in paracortical areas\nlymph entering lymph nodes enter the subcapsular space (=marginal sinus)\n\nthe lymph contains antigen and antigen-bearing DCs from the tissues\n\nT and B cells enter the lymph node via special blood vessels called high endothelial venules (HEVs), found in the T-cell zones\n\n\n\n\n  \n(source: Figure 9-1 from Janeway’s Immunobiology, 9th ed.; Michiel van den Brand, Hematopathology)\n\nMucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs)\n\nPeyer’s patches are lymph node-like structures (contain both a T-cell zone and B-cell follicles)\n\nPeyer’s patches are interspersed beneath the gut epithelium\nM cells channel antigens and pathogens to the Peyer’s patches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Figure 9-1 from Janeway’s Immunobiology, 9th ed.)\n\n\n9-2.
